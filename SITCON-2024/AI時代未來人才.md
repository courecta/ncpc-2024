## GenAI and its Impact

- We too will also be coming into a never seen before world just as:

Only hardware and software world came into a world of the internet &rarr; Internet world will come into a world of A.I.

- The potential of a quick learning A.I. will allow us to overcome the limitations of the past. But A.I. alone won't be able to do so, we must use A.I. not as a tool, but as a *tool person (?)*
- Even after all of the new generation A.I., the most important thing still has been to ask questions. An A.I. never responds if no one asks it for anything
- Innovation is what usually leads to most job growth
- The most effective way to get an A.I.'s answer is to ask good questions, that is what we must learn

### Prompting as a new programming language

- Talk to an A.I. like a person
- It's syntax is good questions

### Be careful about getting an 'Outboard Brain'

- A.I. must give you an understanding, not an answer, not information

### We must be more innovative, to chase the possibility of the new, not the new

We must be a generation that can work together with ourselves and A.I. on another level, on another speed in order to contribute for our future
