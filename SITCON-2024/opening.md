  - try experimenting a custom AI Chatbot
  - Can also use Solidity to make something related to blockchain, or try Arbitrum
  - Have some experience with databases such as MongoDB ( or just NoSQL experience w/ CRUD )
  - Take your writing and online content and add on AdSense
  - Also, after collecting data from your applications, you can try using bigQuery to analyze big data
  - Read a lot more of other people's code and documentation
  - Compile, contribute a big open source project such
    - e.g. Android kernel
  - Contributing to Open Source is important regardless
  - Create your own server? It's something not a lot of student's nowadays will investigate, but making your own host server with an old computer can help you learn how to host platforms and keep it safe
  - Try using WireShark to analyze your traffic and improve your performance

### Enterprise Development

- Try asking your seniors for their company and workplace experience

### Q&A

1. LeetCode is just a way to get in a company, just like a college examination, but whether it makes you a '10x engineer' or anything is on you
2. whether or not you want to go overseas, is up to you and what experience you've gathered such as what your seniors give you
3. Always try to find something you're interested in, as long as that is, you can succeed
